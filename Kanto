Today I start my Pok√©mon Journey!
I FINALLY got my parents to agree to it! My dad is a great flourist but only really knows about his favorite pokemon, sunkurn. 
My mom on the other hand loves learning about pokemon and is excited I am going on this journey. 
She is the Pallet town showcase artist.
She workes to create sculptures with her water and ice pokemon. Squirtle and Ambisnow.
I am definitly going to choose charmander as my starter pokemon.
I have all of my things packed into a backpack, and just before dawn my parents wish me luck and I go to my pokemon adventure.

On my way to Professer Oak's lab I pass my Dad's booth and I leave a note:

I also saw my moms most famous statue.
It was of Ho-oh.
Professer oak was waiting for me at the front of the building.
