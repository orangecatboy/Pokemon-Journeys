Today I start my Pok√©mon Journey!
I FINALLY got my parents to agree to it! My dad is a great flourist but only really knows about his favorite pokemon, sunkurn. 
My mom on the other hand loves learning about pokemon and is excited I am going on this journey. 
She is the Pallet town showcase artist.
She workes to create sculptures with her water and ice pokemon. Squirtle and Ambisnow.
I am definitly going to choose charmander as my starter pokemon.
I have all of my things packed into a backpack, and just before dawn my parents wish me luck and I go to my pokemon adventure.

On my way to Professer Oak's lab I pass my Dad's booth and I leave a note:

I also saw my moms most famous statue.
It was of Ho-oh.
Professer oak was waiting for me at the front of the building.

"Welcome," said Professor Oak he explains that I would normally pick between a Charmander Squirtle and a Bulbasaur. However, they decided that the trainers this week
would choose between Chikorita flabebe and an Eevee. I chose the Eevee it turns out the Eevees are very friendly creatures. He handed me a map and told me that I would
be headed to get my Boulder badge from Brock in Pewter City and then my Cascade badge from Misty In Cerulean city.

Boulder Brock
Cascade Misty
Thunder LT surge
rainbow Erica
Marsh Sabrina
volcano Blaine
Earth Giovanni

He told me that team fuchsia was up to no good and to be on the lookout for anything suspicious. 
I called my parents but got only my dad my mom was working on a new statue in my honor. The first place that I would go to is Brock to get my Boulder badge in Pewter City. 
Professor Oak suggested that I get a water Pokemon on the way. 
Because water Pokemon are strong against rock-type Pokemon and ground type Pokemon.

As I walked I put the Eevee on my shoulder. I decided to name him Evan when suddenly he started chirping loudly I turn around to find an Omanyte, 
it blasted Evan with hydro pump. 
It was a level 9 Omanyte. 
I FREAKED, I ran over to Evan but he sprang up and you Swift the poor Omanyte fainted on the spot. 
"How strong was that Swift" I asked Evan he looked proud, I throw a Pokeball at the Omanyte. I had caught my first pokemon!
I named her Omi.
Later that night I took out my sleeping bag and I took out Omi and Evan. Evan usually liked lying on my shoulder but hey, he has to go into the Pokeball sometimes.
Omi and Evan curled up next to me and fell fast asleep. Soon I did too.
