Today I start my Pok√©mon Journey! I FINALLY got my parents to agree to it! My dad is a great flourist but only really knows about his favorite pokemon, sunkurn. My mom on the other hand loves learning about pokemon and is excited I am going on this journey. She is the Pallet town showcase artist. She workes to create sculptures with her water and ice pokemon. Squirtle and Ambisnow
